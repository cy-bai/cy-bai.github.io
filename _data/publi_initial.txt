    "caption"   : "In this work we present new weighting functions for the anisotropic Kuwahara filter. The anisotropic Kuwahara filter is an edge-preserving filter that is especially useful for creating stylized abstractions from images or videos. It is based on a generalization of the Kuwahara filter that is adapted to the local shape of features. For the smoothing process, the anisotropic Kuwahara filter uses weighting functions that use convolution in their definition. For an efficient implementation, these weighting functions are therefore usually sampled into a texture map. By contrast, our new weighting functions do not require convolution and can be efficiently computed directly during the filtering in real-time. We show that our approach creates output of similar quality as the original anisotropic Kuwahara filter and present an evaluation scheme to compute the new weighting functions efficiently by using rotational symmetries.",

    "caption"   : "Aerial images represent a fundamental type of geodata with a broad range of applications in GIS and geovisualization. The perception and cognitive processing of aerial images by the human, however, still is faced with the specific limitations of photorealistic depictions such as low contrast areas, unsharp object borders as well as visual noise. In this paper we present a novel technique to automatically abstract aerial images that enhances visual clarity and generalizes the contents of aerial images to improve their perception and recognition. The technique applies non-photorealistic image processing by smoothing local image regions with low contrast and emphasizing edges in image regions with high contrast. To handle the abstraction of large images, we introduce an image tiling procedure that is optimized for post-processing images on GPUs and avoids visible artifacts across junctions. This is technically achieved by filtering additional connection tiles that overlap the main tiles of the input image. The technique also allows the generation of different levels of abstraction for aerial images by computing a mipmap pyramid, where each of the mipmap levels is filtered with adapted abstraction parameters. These mipmaps can then be used to perform level-of-detail rendering of abstracted aerial images. Finally, the paper contributes a study to aerial image abstraction by analyzing the results of the abstraction process on distinctive visible elements in common aerial image types. In particular, we have identified a high abstraction straction potential in landscape images and a higher benefit from edge enhancement in urban environments.",

Sie präsentieren eine spezialisierte Form geovirtueller Umgebungen und sind gekennzeichnet durch ein zugrunde liegendes 3D-Geländemodell, einer darin befindlichen 3D-Bebauung sowie des dazu komplementären Straßen-, Grünflächen- und Naturraumes. 3D-Stadtmodell-Systeme ermöglichen es dem Nutzer, sich im Modell interaktiv zu bewegen und sie stellen die Grundfunktionen für die Exploration, Analyse, Präsentation und das Editieren der raumbezogenen Information bereit. Besonders im Gebiet der kartenähnlichen und kartenverwandten 3D-Darstellungen stellen u.a. automatische Verfahren und Techniken zur Stilisierung und Abstraktion von Objekten eines 3D Stadtmodell ein Hauptproblem für die interaktive 3D-Bildsynthese dar. Hier spielt insbesondere die Abstraktion und Illustration potentiell wichtiger Information und somit die Reduzierung der kognitiven Belastung des Nutzers eine tragende Rolle. Diesbezüglich sind Verfahren und Techniken zur nicht-photorealistischen Bildsynthese ein bewährtes Mittel der Computergrafik, deren direkte Anwendung auf ein komplettes 3D-Stadtmodell jedoch häufig monotone sowie gestalterisch und kartographisch stark eingeschränkte Resultate liefert. Eine effiziente und kontextsensitive Kommunikation von 3D-Geoinformation bedarf jedoch der Kopplung von Objektsemantik und Abstraktionsverfahren. Diese Arbeit präsentiert ein Konzept und dessen Umsetzung, das die Auswahl und Parametrisierung von nicht-photorealistischen Darstellungstechniken auf Basis von Objektsemantiken erlaubt (Abbildung 1). Dies ermöglicht die Zuweisung unterschiedlicher automatischer Abstraktionstechniken zu Objekten und Objektgruppen. Der vorgestellte Ansatz ist echtzeitfähig und erlaubt eine interaktive Klassifikation von Objekten und Features zur Laufzeit, wodurch sich u.a. Szenarien zur interaktiven Exploration von thematisch-stilisierten Features bzw. feature-bezogenen Daten visualisieren lassen.

To date, most 3D city models are visualized using photorealistic graphics. But an effective communication of geoinformation significantly depends on how important information is designed and cognitively processed in the given application context. One possibility to visually emphasize important information is based on non-photorealistic rendering, which comprehends artistic depiction styles and is characterized by its expressiveness and communication aspects. However, a direct application of non-photorealistic rendering techniques primarily results in monotonic visualization that lacks cartographic design aspects. In this work, we present concepts for cartography-oriented visualization of virtual 3D city models. These are based on coupling non-photorealistic rendering techniques and semantics-based information for a user, context, and media-dependent representation of thematic information. This work highlights challenges for cartography-oriented visualization of 3D geovirtual environments, presents stylization techniques and discusses their applications and ideas for a standardized visualization. In particular, the presented concepts enable a real-time and dynamic visualization of thematic geoinformation.",

In particular because of the continuous advancements in the acquisition, provision, and visualization of virtual 3D city and landscape models, 3D mapping services, today, represent key components to a growing number of applications, like car navigation, education, or disaster management. However, current systems and applications providing digital 3D maps are faced by drawbacks and limitations, such as occlusion, visual clutter, or insufficient use of screen space, that impact an effective comprehension of geoinformation. To this end, cartographers and computer graphics engineers developed design guidelines, rendering and visualization techniques that aim to increase the effectiveness and expressiveness of digital 3D maps, but whose seamless combination has yet to be achieved. This work discusses potentials of digital 3D maps that are based on combining cartography-oriented rendering techniques and multi-perspective views. For this purpose, a classification of cartographic design principles, visualization techniques, as well as suitable combinations are identified that aid comprehension of digital 3D maps. According to this classification, a prototypical implementation demonstrates the benefits of multi-perspective and non-photorealistic rendering techniques for visualization of 3D map contents. In particular, it enables (1) a seamless combination of cartography-oriented and photorealistic graphic styles while (2) increasing screen-space utilization, and (3) simultaneously directing a viewer’s gaze to important or prioritized information.",

Preserving depth cues within these environments to emphasize spatial relations between geospatial features remains an important issue.A variety of rendering techniques have been developed to preserve depth cues in 3D information visualization, including shading, global illumination, and image stylization. However, these techniques alter color values, which may lead to ambiguity in a color mapping and loss of information. Depending on the applied rendering techniques and color mapping, this loss should be reduced while still preserving depth cues when communicating thematic information. This paper presents the results of a quantitative and qualitative user study that evaluates the impact of rendering techniques on information and spatial perception when using visualization of thematic data in 3D virtual environments.

We present an interactive system that renders water surfaces with cartography-oriented design using the conventions of mapmakers. Our approach is based on the observation that hand-drawn maps utilize and align texture features to shorelines with non-linear distance to improve figure-ground perception and express motion. To obtain local orientation and principal curvature directions, first, our system computes distance and feature-aligned distance maps. Given these maps, waterlining, water stippling, contour-hatching, and labeling are applied in real-time with spatial and temporal coherence. The presented methods can be useful for map exploration, landscaping, urban planning, and disaster management, which is demonstrated by various real-world virtual 3D city and landscape models.",

An effective information transfer of surface properties, encoded by textures, however, depends significantly on how important information is highlighted and cognitively processed by the user in an application context. Edge-preserving image filtering is a promising approach to address this concern while preserving global salient structures. Much research has focused on applying image filters in a post-process stage to foster an artistically stylized rendering, but these approaches are generally not able to preserve depth cues important for 3D visualization (e.g., texture gradient). To this end, filtering that processes texture data coherently with respect to linear perspective and spatial relationships is required. In this work, we present a system that enables to process textured 3D scenes with perspective coherence by arbitrary image filters. We propose decoupled deferred texturing with (1) caching strategies to interactively perform image filtering prior to texture mapping, and (2) for each mipmap level separately to enable a progressive level of abstraction. We demonstrate the potentials of our methods on several applications, including illustrative visualization, focus+context visualization, geometric detail removal, and depth of field. Our system supports frame-to-frame coherence, order-independent transparency, multitexturing, and content-based filtering.",

To serve the different interests of users in specific information, however, the spatial and thematic granularity at which model contents are represented (i.e., level of abstraction) should be dynamically adapted to the user's context, which requires specialized interaction techniques for parameterization. In this work, we present a framework that enables interaction interfaces to parameterize the level-of-abstraction visualization according to spatial, semantic, and thematic data.

This approach facilitates thepresentation of information for virtual 3D city and landscape models, particularly by reducing occlusions, increasing screen-space utilization, and providing additional context within a single image. We complement multi-perspective views with cartographic visualization techniques to stylize features according to their semantics and highlight important or prioritized information. When combined, both techniques constitute the core implementation of interactive, multi-perspective 3D panoramas. They offer a large number of effective means for visual communication of 3D spatial information, a high degree of customization with respect to cartographic design, and manifold applications in different domains. We discuss design decisions of 3D panoramas for the exploration of and navigation in 3D GeoVEs.

In recent years, they have become an increasingly important part of 3D virtual environments for the interactive analysis and communication of complex hierarchical information, for example in routing, logistics optimization, and disaster management. A variety of rendering techniques have been proposed that deal with integrating transportation networks within these environments, but have so far neglected the many challenges of an interactive design process to adapt their spatial and thematic granularity (i.e., level-of-detail and level-of-abstraction) according to a user's context. This paper presents an efficient real-time rendering technique for the view-dependent rendering of geometrically complex transportation networks within 3D virtual environments. Our technique is based on distance fields using deferred texturing that shifts the design process to the shading stage for real-time stylization. We demonstrate and discuss our approach by means of street networks using cartographic design principles for context-aware stylization, including view-dependent scaling for clutter reduction, contour-lining to provide figure-ground, handling of street crossings via shading-based blending, and task-dependent colorization. Finally, we present potential usage scenarios and applications together with a performance evaluation of our implementation.",

For the visual design of 3D scenes, in particular, effective texturing depends significantly on how important contents are expressed, e.g., by preserving global salient structures, and how their depiction is cognitively processed by the user in an application context. Edge-preserving image filtering is one key approach to address these concerns. Much research has focused on applying image filters in a post-process stage to generate artistically stylized depictions. However, these approaches generally do not preserve depth cues, which are important for the perception of 3D visualization (e.g., texture gradient). To this end, filtering is required that processes texture data coherently with respect to linear perspective and spatial relationships. In this work, we present an approach for texturing 3D scenes with perspective coherence by arbitrary image filters. We propose decoupled deferred texturing with (1) caching strategies to interactively perform image filtering prior to texture mapping and (2) for each mipmap level separately to enable a progressive level of abstraction, using (3) direct interaction interfaces to parameterize the visualization according to spatial, semantic, and thematic data.

The visualization of 3D geospatial information, however, raises the question how to represent the information in an effective way. Considerable research has been done in technology-driven directions in the fields of cartography and computer graphics (e.g., design principles, visualization techniques). Here, non-photorealistic rendering represents a promising visualization category–situated between both fields–that offers a large number of degrees for the cartography-oriented visual design of complex 2D and 3D geospatial information for a given application context. Still today, however, specifications and techniques for mapping cartographic design principles to the state-of-the-art rendering pipeline of 3D computer graphics remain to be explored. This paper revisits cartographic design principles for 3D geospatial visualization and introduces an extended 3D semiotic model that complies with the general, interactive visualization pipeline. Based on this model, we propose non-photorealistic rendering techniques to interactively synthesize cartographic renditions of basic feature types, such as terrain, water, and buildings. In particular, it includes a novel iconification concept to seamlessly interpolate between photorealistic and cartographic representations of 3D landmarks. Our work concludes with a discussion of open challenges in this field of research, including topics such as user interaction and evaluation.",

      "caption"   : "With the continuous development of mobile graphics hardware, interactive high-quality image stylization based on nonlinear filtering is becoming feasible and increasingly used in casual creativity apps. However, these apps often only serve high-level controls to parameterize image filters and generally lack support for low-level (artistic) control, thus automating art creation rather than assisting it. This work presents a GPU-based framework that enables to parameterize image filters at three levels of control: (1) presets followed by (2) global parameter adjustments can be interactively refined by (3) complementary on-screen painting that operates within the filters' parameter spaces for local adjustments. The framework provides a modular XML-based effect scheme to effectively build complex image processing chains-using these interactive filters as building blocks-that can be efficiently processed on mobile devices. Thereby, global and local parameterizations are directed with higher-level algorithmic support to ease the interactive editing process, which is demonstrated by state-of-the-art stylization effects, such as oil paint filtering and watercolor rendering.",
